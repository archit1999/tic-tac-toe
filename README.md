# tic-tac-toe

 - A GUI based tic-tac-toe game, developed using Java and Swing,
 
 - Next move predictor works on kind of greedy algo, i.e. first try to win the game in next move, if not possible try to prevent opposition to win in the next move,
   else choose a random move.
 
 - This algo ensures us to atleast draw the game, if not win.
